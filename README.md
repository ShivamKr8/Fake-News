# Fake-News

- Fake news do not require any introduction. It is very much easy to spread all the fake information in today’s all-connected world across the internet.
- It is sometimes transmitted through the internet by some unauthorised sources, which creates issues for the targeted person and it makes them panic and leads to even violence. To combat the spread of fake news, it’s critical to determine the information’s legitimacy, which this Data Science project can help with. 
- To do so, Python can be used, and a model is created using TfidfVectorizer. PassiveAggressiveClassifier can be implemented to distinguish between true and fake news. 
- Pandas, NumPy, and sci-kit-learn are some Python packages suitable for this project, and we can utilize News.csv for the dataset.
- Data is taken from kaggle.
